Thank you for installing the Pod Restart Notifier!

1. To check the deployment:
    $ kubectl get deployments -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Release.Name }}

2. To see the operator logs:
    $ kubectl logs -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l app=pod-restart-notifier

3. To verify the operator's functionality, you can induce a restart in a pod and then check the operator logs or your Discord channel, Microsoft Teams, or Slack for notifications.

Setup:
- Ensure you have your Discord webhook URL set up to receive the notifications.
- For Microsoft Teams, set up an incoming webhook connector in your Teams channel to get a webhook URL.
- For Slack, create an incoming webhook from the "Apps" section in your Slack workspace to receive a webhook URL.

Configuration:
- If you need to adjust the webhook URLs, you can update the Helm release or modify the `values.yaml`.

Happy monitoring!
