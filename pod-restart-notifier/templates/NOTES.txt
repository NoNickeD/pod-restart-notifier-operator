Thank you for installing the Pod Restart Notifier!

1. To check the deployment:
    $ kubectl get deployments -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Release.Name }}

2. To see the operator logs:
    $ kubectl logs -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l app=pod-restart-notifier

3. To verify the operator's functionality, you can induce a restart in a pod and then check the operator logs or your Discord channel for notifications.

Remember, you should have your Discord webhook URL set up to receive the notifications. If you need to adjust the webhook, you can update the Helm release.

Happy monitoring!
